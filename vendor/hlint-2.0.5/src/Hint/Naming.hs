    Suggest the use of camelCase

    Only permit:
    _*[A-Za-z]*_*#*'*

    Apply this to things that would get exported by default only
    Also allow prop_ as it's a standard QuickCheck idiom
    Also allow case_ as it's a standard test-framework-th idiom
    Also allow test_ as it's a standard tasty-th idiom
    Also allow numbers separated by _
    Also don't suggest anything mentioned elsewhere in the module
