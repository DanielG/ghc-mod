		  Happy Haskell programming on Emacs

Features:

1) Completions of keyword, module, class, function, types,
   language extensions, etc.
2) Flymake with GHC and hlint
3) Inserting code template
4) Determining and displaying the type of an identifier

The "ghc-mod" program written in Haskell is a backend to gather
information from GHC and hlint.

Elisp libraries including ghc-mod is an extension to haskell-mode.
You should put the followings in your "~/.emacs.el":

    (autoload 'ghc-init "ghc" nil t)
    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook (lambda () (ghc-init)))

or

    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook (lambda () (ghc-init) (flymake-mode)))

If you want the type of an identifier under the point to be shown
automatically, also call (ghc-turn-on-show-type) in your mode-hook.
The delay after which the type is shown can be controlled via
the `ghc-show-type-delay' variable.
This feature does not yet work for things defined in the current file.
