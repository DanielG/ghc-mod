ghc-mod was originally licensed under the BSD3 but the primary license has been
changed to the AGPL3, files originally contributed under the BSD3 license remain
under this license and can generally be identified by the lack of a GPL header.

See the files COPYING.BSD3 and COPYING.AGPL3 in the source distribution for
copies of the two licenses.
